        <p><strong>According to journalist Rob from RJPJournalism, Chelsea could agree to pay even more than 120 million euros for Enzo Fernandez from Benfica, but with one condition.</strong></p>
        <p> <em>Chelsea have told Benfica that they will offer €120m for Enzo - €80m will be paid upfront. <br>
            "In my opinion, if Chelsea raise the amount to 100 million euros up front, something can be done." <br>
            "And again - I think that if Chelsea were willing to pay a little more than 120 million euros if the deal was done in installments," said Rob.</em> </p>

        <p><strong>A recent report from The Mirror mentions that Barcelona are considering bringing in Chelsea midfielder Jorginho. It is believed that the Catalan club is considering the Italian as a replacement for Sergio Busquets at the Nou Camp.</strong></p>
        <p><em>Jorginho has had a mixed start to this campaign as he fails to help Chelsea achieve consistent results in the Premier League. The 30-year-old has scored one goal in eight Blues appearances in all competitions. <br>
            The Brazilian native deserves some credit for averaging 1.7 rebounds, 1.2 steals and 0.5 key passes per 90 minutes in the Premier League. He distributes the ball well in midfield, completing 85.1% of his passes in the big leagues. <br>
            Jorginho's current contract at Stamford Bridge expires at the end of this season. Thus, Barça have every chance of getting him on the cheap in January or on a free transfer next summer.</em></p>
