        <p class="text"><strong>Sharks </strong><em>are a group of elasmobranch fish
            characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to 
            seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral
             fins that are not fused to the head. 
             Shark eyes are similar to the eyes of other
                 vertebrates, including similar lenses, corneas 
                 and retinas, though their eyesight is well adapted
                  to the marine environment with the help of a
                   tissue called tapetum lucidum.Shark is
                    awesome because.</em></p>
